Work within Stackerstan follows a pattern of accurately identifying Problems and applying minimal solutions to these Problems.

A problem is an observed matter or situation regarded as unsatisfactory.

There are no bug reports, bugs are just problems to solve.

There are no feature requests, features are solutions to problems.

Please describe the problem as accurately as possible. For example: 
"Problem: the interface hurts my eyes because it's very bright and I'm a reptillian"

You are also welcome to propose a solution:
"Possible solution: create a dark theme"

To show that you understand, please make the title of your new issues start with "Problem:"
