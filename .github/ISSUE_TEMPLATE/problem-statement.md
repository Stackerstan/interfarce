Work within Stackerstan follows a pattern of accurately identifying Problems and applying minimal solutions to these Problems.

A problem is an observed matter or situation regarded as unsatisfactory.

There are no bug reports, bugs are just problems to solve.

There are no feature requests, features are solutions to problems.

The title of your problem should start with "Problem:"
